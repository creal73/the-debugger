# the-debugger
"The Debugger" is a mini-game where the user catches bugs and destroys them ! 

`Catch them all !! B-)`

## How To

- `npm start` to run the application on a local development server
- `npm run build` to build production package
- `npm run serve:dist` and `npm test` to execute integration test

## Requirements

- [X] user must be able to draw rectangles of random colors using the mouse.
- [X] when double-clicking on a rectangle it does a 360Â° rotation and disappears once the rotation is complete.
- [X] when double-clicking on several rectangles, all the rotations must be done before removing the rectangles.


## Ideas of improvements

- [X] Think about mouse size when drawing a bug
- [X] Extract 'Bug' in its own class
- [X] Add tests
- [ ] Use Web Components ?
